# Electricity Usage Prediction & Forecasting Using Decision Tree

## Overview
This repository focuses on predicting electricity usage patterns using a Decision Tree Regressor. The goal is to forecast future electricity demand based on historical consumption data, helping electricity providers optimize production and distribution.  

This repository includes:
- A visualization of the real decision tree used for prediction.
- A simplified version of the tree for better interpretability.
